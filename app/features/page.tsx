                Record appliances, installations, furniture, safety equipment,
                and other home components. Each item keeps its room, model,
                serial number, purchase details, warranty, documents,
                maintenance, and repairs together.

                Create one-time or recurring work, assign it to a household
                member, and record completion, notes, cost, and service
                providers. Homi calculates the next due date on the server and
                safely handles retries.
