            <h2>What Homi stores</h2>
            <p>
                Homi stores account details, the home information you choose to
                enter, activity needed to operate the service, and files you
                upload. It does not include advertising trackers or third-party
                analytics by default.
            </p>
            <h2>Why it is processed</h2>
            <p>
                Data is processed to provide the journal, authenticate you,
                enforce household permissions, deliver reminders you request,
                prevent abuse, and maintain security. Email delivery and object
                storage providers act as processors when configured.
            </p>
            <h2>Your choices</h2>
            <p>
                You can update records, export account data in JSON, change
                reminder preferences, and revoke sessions. Until the
                owner-transfer and self-service deletion workflow is complete,
                contact the deployment operator for deletion and home
                portability requests. Minimal audit or backup data may be
                retained for a documented security and recovery period.
            </p>
            <h2>Security and contact</h2>
            <p>
                Files are private, sensitive tokens are hashed or securely
                managed, and authorization is checked on the server. Contact{" "}
                {process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPPORT_EMAIL ?? "support@homi.local"}{" "}
                for access, correction, deletion, portability, or privacy
                questions.
